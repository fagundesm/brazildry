# MEE3_070_sm_NOa

# A general method for combining different data types into
# a unified multivariate analysis of niche overlap.
# This program calculates niche overlaps over multiple niche axes
# when each axis of niche space is measured using THE SAME
# individuals.

# Program reads in individual data,  calculates 
# electivity scores for any resource usage variables,
# calculate niche overlaps between pairs of species, and
# runs null model tests of (i) differential use of niche 
# space by multiple species; and (ii) even distribution 
# of species across niche space.

# This illustration examines mean niche overlap between three species
# on six niche axes (1) Habitat association 
# (resource selection); (2) ticks (count data); (3) colour 
# categorical data; (4) sex (binary data); (5) tailbody (proportion 
# data); and (6) weight (measurement data)

# Data is read into the program from external datafiles:
# 1. "MEE3_070_sm_ExampleA.txt" measurements for each individual across
# the six niche axes
# 2. "MEE3_070_sm_ExampleAhabitatAvail.txt" resource availability data

# Likewise, functions are read into the program from
# the file "MEE3_070_sm_NicheFunctions.txt"

# The analysis is divided into four distinct sections, 
# each identified by
#############################################################
# 1. Analysis A: Niche Overlap incorporating multiple niche axes
# 2. Tests determining if two species occupy different niche space,
#    seperately for each each axis, and for niche overlap averaged
#    across axes.
# 3. Tests determining if the species are evenly distributed across,
#    or clumped within niche space. This is done seperately for each
#    each axis, and for niche overlap averaged across axes.
# 4. The compilation of the above results into a single R object

# electivity may be included as a categorical type of data.

# The input data set is a .txt file.
# It needs to have its first two columns
# labelled "id" and "species". Subsequent columns are
# individual-based variables, one per column.

# Input the individual data file:
